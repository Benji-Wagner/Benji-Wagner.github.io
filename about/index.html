	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>While I like to think I know a thing or two about data science and statistics, 
  I'm really just a goofball who wants to experience the world. This page is meant to be a light-hearted
  window into my life. Also, having your own website is actually really cool!</p>
  
  <h4>Growing Up</h4>
  
  <p>I grew up in El Mirage, Arizona, but attended schools in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. 
  This sprawling city is absolutely massive, and commuting from El Mirage to Central Phoenix everyday was a one hour trip.
  While I certainly had plenty of unforgettable moments in Arizona, I do not miss the hot summers there. I guess you could
  say the 110+ degree heat pushed me to the east coast. Here's one of my last memorable moments from Arizona State
  University:

  <h4>Family</h4>
  
  <p>Although I have a somewhat large family (I can't keep up with my mom's family tree),
  I only really talk to immediate family. This is in part because of how spread out my family is. At the moment,
  my mom lives in Arizona, my brother lives in Chicago, his fiancee lives in LA, my dad lives in Maryland, my mom's
  family lives in parts of Malaysia, Philadelphia, and California, and my dad's family lives in rural Minnesota. Phew!</p>
  
  <p>I took family for granted up until the end of my undergraduate career. Now I enjoy taking trips up to Maryland to
  visit my dad, and I try to fly out to Arizona when I have breaks. I think change was intitiated by the birth of
  my two baby sisters. </p>
