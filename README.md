This is my page where I aim to post some projects I've worked on recently. I work primarily in R and Python, and this page is a repository of projects I've worked on. I'm hoping to begin a career in Data Science, so I hope some of my work will help me get noticed by recruiters, hiring managers, etc. I'm also open to receiving feedback about my work, so feel free to add any comments or suggestions. This page is a work-in-progress, as I'm unfamiliar with hosting a website through Jekyll.
